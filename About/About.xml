  <description>At it's most basic level this mod sets most things to be constructed by stuff rather than a static cost. This translates into being able to make lamps and smithies and solar panels and all kinds of other things out of any metal you like (currently works with Cupro's Alloys for additional metal types). Also allows furniture to be made of any type of wood or similar material where appropriate (this mod adds new types of wood that you can get from the vanilla trees).

Includes new carpet colors with burned variant for the new burned floors.

Currently has compatibility for Cupro's Alloys and Vegetable Garden trees.
